# Flight-Analysis-using-Pyspark

I will explore and analyze the ‘airline-delay-and-cancellation-data-2009-2018’  dataset, using the appropriate technologies and methodologies, to expand and  further understanding the data.

NB#

Data was extracted and placed onto linux based system and then Hadoop (HFDS): HDFS, or Hadoop Distributed File System, is a distributed file system that runs on commodity 
hardware. 

Analysis completed on Pyspark - PySpark is a Python interface to Apache Spark. It includes the PySpark shell for interactively examining data in a distributed environment, as well as the ability to develop Spark applications using Python APIs. Most Spark technologies, such as Spark SQL, DataFrame, Streaming, MLlib 
(Machine Learning), and Spark Core, are supported by PySpark.


DATASET

Data taken from Harvard Dataverse: https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/HG7NV7
The dataset consists of flight and departure details for all commercial flights within the United 
States, from 2009 to 2018

The data used consists of Airline on-time data. Every two years, at the Joint Statistical Meetings, 
the Graphics Section and the Computing Section collaborate every two years during the Joint 
Statistical Meetings to host a special Poster Session named The Data Exposition, but more 
generally known as The Data Expo.
